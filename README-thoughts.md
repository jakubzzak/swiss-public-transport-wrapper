## Thoughts

It was a bit time intensive, postgres DB took me a bit to figure my way around it but eventually run out of time.

The external API also puzzled me for a while, mid way through I realised I was approaching it wrongly and had to start all over in the connections part.

Next steps:

When I stopped, I was about to make postgres connection work, also wanted to add the cursor functionality and jump on the mutation to expose it via API.

Overall a very nice challenge and it bugs me that I couldn't finish it, but I also understand the instructions and idea behind them.
